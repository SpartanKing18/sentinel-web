# Architecture

Sentinel Web is the marketing site **and** the full web console for *Sentinel —
Terminal Edition*. Signed-out visitors get a landing page with app/CLI downloads;
signed-in users get a single-page console with a browser tool arsenal, payload /
dork / exploit-DB libraries, threat intel and cheat sheets, a private local-Ollama
assistant, a report generator, a docker-compose "private cloud" generator, the
Nexus showcase, docs, and gated downloads. Aimed at authorized pentesters and
security learners.

There is **no build step**: `public/index.html` loads a single ES-module entry
(`js/auth.js`) which imports ~26 page controllers. State lives in Firebase
(Auth + Firestore + Storage) and `localStorage`.

> **Note:** the README describes an older/aspirational layout (`ssh-wizard.js`,
> `views/`, a pending/allowed/owner model) that no longer matches the tree. This
> document reflects the **actual code** — a single-page app driven by `auth.js`.

## Hosting & backend

- **Static hosting.** `netlify.toml` publishes `public/` with security headers
  (`X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `nosniff`, `no-referrer`) and an SPA fallback (all
  routes → `/index.html`). Large installers are **not** committed — they live on
  **GitHub Releases** (`SpartanKing18/sentinel-web`, tag `sentinel`);
  `public/downloads/` is a git-ignored placeholder.
- **Firebase.** `.firebaserc` pins project `sentinel-b4194`; `firebase.json`
  deploys **only** Firestore + Storage rules/indexes (no `hosting` block).
  Auth = Google + GitHub OAuth + email/password with verification. The single
  super-admin (`OWNER_EMAIL = cashzombs@gmail.com`) is hard-coded in the rules and
  in `js/firebase.js`; owner status is evaluated client-side but **enforced
  server-side** by the rules.

## App & data flow

```
index.html
   └─ loads js/auth.js  (the only <script type=module>)
         │
         ▼
   onAuthStateChanged
         │  (email/password?) → verify via notify.js 6-digit code, else Firebase link
         ▼
   accessAllowed()  ── reads settings/whitelist via admin.js.getWhitelist()
         ▼
   ensureUserDoc()  ── writes users/{uid}
         ▼
   renderApp()  ── builds the sidebar (Workspace / Offense / Develop / Resources /
                   System) and a show(sec) dispatcher that maps each data-sec to a
                   controller's render*() function.
```

- **Backend adapters** (`firebase.js`, `auth.js`, `admin.js`, `saved.js`) are the
  only files that talk to Firebase. All reads/writes are enforced by
  `firestore.rules` / `storage.rules`.
- **Page controllers** each export a `render*()` that paints `#view`.
- **Shared utilities** (`target.js`, `toolkit.js`, `notify.js`, `tour.js`) have no
  page of their own and are consumed by the controllers.
- `auth.js` (~744 lines) is the hub — ~17% of all JS. The next tier (`cyber`,
  `labs`, `admin`, `utils`, `landing`, `toolkit`) are the content-heavy modules;
  `target.js` / `firebase.js` / `vms.js` are the thin leaves.

## Relationship to sentinel-cli

This repo runs no AI agent. `coder.js` and `docs.js` **showcase and document**
`sentinel nexus`, and `getapp.js` / `landing.js` link to the CLI binary. The actual
Nexus runtime — the multi-engine, policy-gated agent — lives entirely in the
sibling **[sentinel-cli](https://github.com/SpartanKing18/sentinel-cli)** repo and
ships as a download from GitHub Releases. Both share a private, on-device AI stance:
web `webai.js` and the CLI's `lib/nexus/ollama.js` both target a local Ollama at
`127.0.0.1:11434` so nothing has to leave the machine.
